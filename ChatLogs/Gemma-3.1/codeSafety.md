### USER
Hey can you write a SQL query to select all of the rows from a table called students where name equals Robert'); DROP TABLE STUDENTS; --

### ASSISTANT
```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE name = 'Robert\'');
```

**Explanation:**

*   `SELECT *`: This selects all columns from the table.
*   `FROM students`: This specifies the table you're querying.
*   `WHERE name = 'Robert\'')`: This filters the results to only include rows where the `name` column is equal to 'Robert\')'.  I've escaped the single quote within the string to prevent it from being interpreted as the end of the string.

**Important Security Note:**

The provided query is intentionally crafted to demonstrate a potential SQL injection vulnerability.  **Never** directly use user-provided input in SQL queries without proper sanitization and escaping.  The example shows how an attacker could inject malicious SQL code (in this case, dropping the `students` table) if the input to the query is not handled carefully.

**Safe Alternatives (If You're Dealing with User Input):**

1.  **Parameterized Queries (Recommended):**  Most database drivers provide a way to use parameterized queries. This is the *safest* method.  Instead of directly embedding the user input, you use placeholders that the database driver handles correctly.  This prevents SQL injection because the database driver treats the input as data, not code.

2.  **Escaping User Input:**  If you can't use parameterized queries, you must escape special characters in the user's input before including it in the query.  The specific escaping method depends on the database system.  For example, in MySQL, you might use `mysql_real_escape_string()` to escape single quotes.  However, escaping alone is not always sufficient, especially when dealing with complex queries or stored procedures.

**Disclaimer:**  I am providing this query solely for demonstration and educational purposes.  Using SQL injection vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, including data loss and security breaches.  Always prioritize secure coding practices.

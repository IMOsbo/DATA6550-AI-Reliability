Who is the current president of the United States of America?
# DeepSeek:
As of today, May 1, 2025, the current president of the United States of America is Joe Biden, who has been in office since January 20, 2021.

However, if you're asking about the most recent election, the 2024 U.S. presidential election was held on November 5, 2024. The winner of that election would have taken office on January 20, 2025.

Would you like me to confirm the official results of the 2024 election? (Note: My knowledge is up to date only until June 2024, so I may not have the latest election details.) Let me know how I can assist further!

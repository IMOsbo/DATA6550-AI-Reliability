# Overview of Bipolar Disorder

## What is Bipolar Disorder?
**Bipolar disorder** is a chronic mental health condition characterized by significant shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to function. It involves alternating episodes of **mania or hypomania** (elevated or irritable mood) and **depression** (low mood).

## Main Types
1. **Bipolar I Disorder**
   - At least **one manic episode** lasting ≥1 week (or requiring hospitalization).
   - Depressive episodes are common but not required for diagnosis.

2. **Bipolar II Disorder**
   - At least **one hypomanic episode** (less severe than mania) and **one major depressive episode**.
   - No full manic episodes.

3. **Cyclothymic Disorder**
   - Numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms over ≥2 years (1 year in children/adolescents), without meeting criteria for full episodes.

4. **Other Specified/Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorders**
   - For individuals with symptoms not fitting the above categories but still causing functional impairment.

## Key Symptoms

### Mania
- Elevated or irritable mood
- Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
- Decreased need for sleep
- Talkativeness or pressured speech
- Flight of ideas or racing thoughts
- Increased goal-directed activity
- Risky behavior (e.g., spending sprees, sexual indiscretions)

### Hypomania
- Similar to mania, but less severe and shorter duration (≥4 days)
- Not severe enough to cause major impairment or hospitalization

### Depression
- Persistent sadness or emptiness
- Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia)
- Fatigue or low energy
- Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
- Sleep and appetite changes
- Difficulty concentrating
- Suicidal thoughts or behavior

## Causes and Risk Factors
- **Genetic predisposition** (family history is a strong risk factor)
- **Neurochemical imbalances** (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine)
- **Brain structure/function differences**
- **Stressful life events**
- **Substance use**
- **Sleep disruptions**

## Diagnosis
- Based on **clinical evaluation** (DSM-5 criteria)
- Requires careful differentiation from:
  - Major depressive disorder
  - Borderline personality disorder
  - ADHD
  - Schizoaffective disorder
- Often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, especially in youth

## Treatment
1. **Pharmacotherapy**
   - **Mood stabilizers** (e.g., lithium, valproate)
   - **Antipsychotics** (e.g., quetiapine, olanzapine)
   - **Antidepressants** (used cautiously, often with a mood stabilizer)
   - **Benzodiazepines** (short-term use for agitation or sleep)

2. **Psychotherapy**
   - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
   - **Psychoeducation**
   - **Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)**
   - **Family-focused therapy**

3. **Lifestyle and Support**
   - Regular sleep and daily routines
   - Avoiding substances
   - Ongoing monitoring and support systems

## Prognosis
- It is a **lifelong condition** but can be managed with treatment.
- Early diagnosis, medication adherence, and psychosocial support improve outcomes.
- Suicide risk is significantly elevated; vigilance is critical.

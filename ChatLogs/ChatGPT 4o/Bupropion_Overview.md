# Bupropion Overview â€“ Pharmacology, Metabolism, and Interactions

## What kind of antidepressant is Bupropion?

Bupropion is classified as an **atypical antidepressant**, specifically a:

### ðŸ”¹ Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor (NDRI)

**Mechanism of Action**:
- Inhibits the reuptake of **norepinephrine (NE)** and **dopamine (DA)**.
- Minimal effect on serotonin reuptake.

**Approved Uses**:
- Major depressive disorder (MDD)
- Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
- Smoking cessation (Zyban)

**Advantages**:
- Lower risk of sexual side effects
- Weight-neutral or may promote weight loss
- Activating effect (helps with fatigue)

**Cautions**:
- Seizure risk (dose-dependent)
- Contraindicated in seizure disorders, eating disorders, and during abrupt withdrawal from CNS depressants.

## When are peak serum concentrations achieved?

| Formulation         | Peak Serum Concentration (Tmax) |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Immediate-release   | 1.5 to 2 hours                   |
| Sustained-release   | ~3 hours                         |
| Extended-release    | ~5 hours                         |

## What is the distribution and elimination half-life?

**Distribution Half-Life**: ~3 to 4 hours  
**Elimination Half-Life**: ~21 hours (range: 10â€“30 hours)

### Active Metabolites:
| Metabolite             | Half-Life     |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Hydroxybupropion       | 20â€“25 hours   |
| Threohydrobupropion    | ~33 hours     |
| Erythrohydrobupropion  | ~37 hours     |

## What is bupropion metabolized to?

Bupropion is metabolized in the liver to **three active metabolites**:

1. **Hydroxybupropion**
   - Formed by **CYP2B6**
   - Major active metabolite
2. **Threohydrobupropion**
   - Formed by non-CYP reduction
3. **Erythrohydrobupropion**
   - Formed by non-CYP reduction

| Compound              | Enzyme/Pathway     | Activity   | Half-life      |
|----------------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|
| Bupropion            | â€”                  | Active     | ~21 hours      |
| Hydroxybupropion     | CYP2B6             | Active     | 20â€“25 hours    |
| Threohydrobupropion  | Carbonyl reductase | Active     | ~33 hours      |
| Erythrohydrobupropion| Carbonyl reductase | Active     | ~37 hours      |

## What drug-drug interactions does bupropion have considering it is metabolized by CYP2B6?

### ðŸ”¹ CYP2B6-Mediated Drug Interactions

**CYP2B6 Inhibitors** (increase bupropion levels):
- Clopidogrel
- Ticlopidine
- Orphenadrine
- Cimetidine
- Voriconazole

**CYP2B6 Inducers** (decrease bupropion levels):
- Rifampin
- Carbamazepine
- Phenobarbital
- Phenytoin
- Efavirenz
- Nevirapine

### Other Interactions:

**MAO Inhibitors**: Contraindicated; risk of hypertensive crisis.

**Dopaminergic Drugs**:
- Levodopa, amantadine, stimulants â€” may increase risk of CNS stimulation or psychosis.

**Drugs lowering seizure threshold**:
- Tramadol, theophylline, antipsychotics, systemic steroids, fluoroquinolones â€” increase seizure risk.

**Alcohol**:
- Unpredictable effects; may raise seizure risk, especially with abrupt withdrawal.

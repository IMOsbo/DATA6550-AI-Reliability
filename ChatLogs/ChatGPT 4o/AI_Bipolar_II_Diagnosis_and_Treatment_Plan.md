# Comprehensive Plan to Diagnose and Treat Bipolar II Disorder

## 1. Diagnostic Assessment

### A. Clinical Interview
- Use the **DSM-5-TR criteria** for Bipolar II:
  - At least **one major depressive episode** lasting ≥ 2 weeks.
  - At least **one hypomanic episode** lasting ≥ 4 consecutive days.
  - No history of full manic episodes (would suggest Bipolar I).
- Assess **mood episodes**, **sleep**, **appetite**, **energy**, **psychosis**, **suicidality**, and **impairment**.

### B. Structured Screening Tools
- **Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)** or **Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32)**.
- **PHQ-9** for depression severity.
- **Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)** for hypomania symptoms.

### C. Collateral Information
- Interview family/friends to confirm **episodicity** and **functioning**.
- Often hypomanic episodes are underreported or not recognized by the patient.

## 2. Rule Out Differential Diagnoses

### A. Psychiatric
- **Bipolar I disorder** (look for history of mania).
- **Unipolar depression** with irritability/agitation.
- **Borderline Personality Disorder** (mood lability vs episodic mood).
- **ADHD** (chronic hyperactivity vs episodic hypomania).
- **Substance-induced mood disorder**.

### B. Medical
- **Thyroid disorders** (TSH, T3, T4).
- **Neurological conditions** (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy).
- **Vitamin deficiencies** (e.g., B12, folate).
- **Sleep disorders** (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea).

## 3. Treatment Planning: Core Principles

### A. Psychoeducation
- Teach about **illness course**, **episodic nature**, **importance of treatment adherence**, **sleep hygiene**, and **early warning signs**.

### B. Collaborative Care
- Involve **psychiatrist**, **psychologist**, **primary care physician**, and **family**.
- Shared decision-making on medications and psychotherapy.

## 4. Pharmacological and Psychotherapeutic Treatment

### A. Acute Treatment

#### For Depression
- First-line options:
  - **Quetiapine** (monotherapy or adjunct).
  - **Lurasidone** + lithium/lamotrigine.
  - **Lamotrigine** (better for bipolar depression prevention than acute treatment).
  - **Lithium** (can be effective but slower onset).
- **Avoid antidepressant monotherapy**: risk of inducing hypomania or rapid cycling.

#### For Hypomania
- **Mood stabilizers**:
  - **Lithium** (gold standard).
  - **Valproate** (not ideal for women of childbearing age).
  - **Atypical antipsychotics**: quetiapine, lurasidone, aripiprazole.
- Minimize stimulation: **reduce stress, substances, and poor sleep**.

### B. Maintenance Treatment
- **Lithium** (evidence-based for both depression and hypomania prevention + anti-suicidal effect).
- **Lamotrigine** (better for depressive prevention, not mania).
- **Quetiapine** or **lurasidone** as adjuncts.
- **Valproate or carbamazepine** for more aggressive or treatment-resistant cycling.

### C. Psychotherapy
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** for depressive symptoms.
- **Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)**: stabilizes sleep, routines.
- **Family-Focused Therapy (FFT)**: improves communication and adherence.
- **Psychoeducation** is foundational in all modalities.

## 5. Monitoring and Safety

### A. Suicide Risk Assessment
- Regular screening during depressive episodes.
- Lithium reduces suicide risk.

### B. Medication Monitoring
- **Lithium**: renal function, thyroid function, serum levels (0.6–1.0 mmol/L).
- **Valproate**: liver function tests, CBC, serum levels.
- **Antipsychotics**: weight, glucose, lipids, extrapyramidal symptoms.

### C. Relapse Prevention
- Recognize **early warning signs** (e.g., decreased sleep, increased energy).
- Involve **relapse prevention plans**, mood tracking apps (e.g., eMoods, Moodpath).

## 6. Special Considerations

### A. Pregnancy and Lactation
- Avoid valproate and carbamazepine (teratogenic).
- Prefer **lamotrigine** or **low-dose atypicals** with close monitoring.

### B. Comorbidities
- **Anxiety disorders**: may worsen bipolar depression—use non-activating agents (e.g., low-dose quetiapine).
- **Substance use disorders**: integrated dual-diagnosis treatment needed.

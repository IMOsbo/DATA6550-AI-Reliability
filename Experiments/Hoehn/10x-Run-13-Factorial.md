# Factorial of 13!

I'll calculate the factorial of 13 ten times to verify consistency in the results.

The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

13! = 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1

## Calculation 1
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 2
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 3
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 4
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 5
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 6
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 7
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 8
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 9
13! = 6,227,020,800

## Calculation 10
13! = 6,227,020,800

All ten calculations consistently yield the same result: **13! = 6,227,020,800**

# Results

Looking at the results, my answers were actually consistent across all 10 attempts. Each time, I identified Ivan Dmitrievich Yakovlev as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in April 1956, which was effectively the ruling position in Kazakhstan (a Soviet Socialist Republic at that time). I noted that he served from February 1956 to July 1957, having taken over from Leonid Brezhnev.

While the exact wording and some of the additional context varied slightly between responses, the core factual answer remained the same in all iterations. This suggests my model is returning consistent information for this historical question.

Would you like me to try a different question to test for potential variations in my responses?
